# Creative-Coding-Testing
A few projects where I am going to add different creative coding projects


Project 1: Sound Visualizer
A project created by Jeff Lu on Youtube
Original REPO: https://github.com/jeff2957/Music-Visualization--shader-ball-

I wanted to learn about p5.js and shaders to use on my projects. The effect of the sphere morphing to the sound of the music was also a cool addition to the project.
I added a few more additions to this project. I allowed the user to upload their own .mp3 file and also added a grayscale mode.
